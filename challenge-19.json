    "question": "A number x, when divided by a divisor leaves a remainder 9. Twice the number divided by the same divisor leaves a remainder 5. Find the divisor.",
    "solution": "Let the divisor be d and the quotient obtained on dividing x by d be y.\r\n\r\nNumber = Quotient*Divisor + Remainder\r\n\r\nx = yd+9\r\n\r\nTwice the number = 2yd+18\r\n\r\nWhen 2yd+18 is divided by the same divisor d,\r\n\ta remainder of 5 is obtained.\r\n\r\n2yd is divisible by d. So, 18 divided by d should leave a remainder of 5.\r\n\r\nHence, d=13."
