      "question": "Ferrari S.P.A is an Italian sports car manufacturer based in Maranello, Italy. Founded by Enzo Ferrari in 1928 as Scuderia Ferrari, the company sponsored drivers and manufactured race cars before moving into production of street-legal vehicles in 1947 as Ferrari S.P.A. Throughout its history, the company has been noted for its continued participation in racing, especially in Formula One where it has employed great success. Rohit once bought a Ferrari. It could go 4 times as fast as Mohan's old Mercedes. If the speed of Mohan's Mercedes is 35 km/hr and the distance traveled by the Ferrari is 490 km, find the total time, in hours, taken by Rohit to drive that distance.",
      "solution": "Speed of Rohit's Ferrari\n= 35*4 = 140 kmph\nTime taken\n= 490/140\n= 3.5 hrs"

      "question": "A hare and a tortoise have a race along a circle of 100 yards diameter. The tortoise goes in one direction and the hare in the other. The hare starts after the tortoise has covered 1/5 of its distance and that too leisurely. The hare and tortoise meet when the hare has covered only 1/8 of the distance. By what factor should the hare increase its speed so as to tie the race?",
      "solution": "Time taken by the hare to cover 1/8 of the distance\n= Time taken by the tortoise to cover 27/40 [(7/8)-(1/5)] of the distance\n\n1/8h = 27/40t\n\nt = 27h/5\n\nLet the new speed of the hare be h1 yards/s.\n\nTime taken by the hare to cover to 7/8 of the distance should equal\nthe time taken by the tortoise to cover 1/8 of the distance.\n\n7/8h1 = 1/8t\n\nh1 = 7t \n     = 7*27h/5\n     = 37.8 h"
