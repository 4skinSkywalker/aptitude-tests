He also authored the eponymous Lilavati, a compendium of mathematical puzzles, in which the number of problems that use this formula is the sum of two prime numbers. The product of the two prime numbers is smaller than the total number of problems in the Lilavati. Now, if the difference of any two numbers is 4 and their product is 18, what is the sum of their squares?",
