  "formula": "HCF (Highest Common Factor):\nThe HCF of two or more numbers is the largest number which exactly divides each of them.\n\nExample:\n\nFind the HCF of 15 and 21.\nExpress the numbers as the product of primes.\n15=3*5\n21=3*7\nThe common factor is 3.\nHCF=3\n\nLCM (Lowest Common Multiple):\nAs the expansion says, the LCM of two or more numbers is the lowest number which is exactly divisible by each of them.\n\nExample:\n\nFind the LCM of 15 and 21.\nLCM(15,21)\n= LCM(3*5,3*7)\n= 3*5*7\n= 105\nThe common factor has to be multiplied only once.\n\n(i)The product of two numbers = HCF*LCM\n15*21 = 3*105\n\n(ii)The least number which when divided by two numbers x and y, leaving the same remainder z in each case is\nLCM(x,y) + z\n\n(iii)The least number which when divided by two numbers x and y, leaving remainders a and b, where x-a = y-b = k, is\nLCM(x,y) - k\n\nWhy? Let's reason with numbers.\n\n'Find the LEAST NUMBER which when divided by x, y and z leaves the remainders a, b and c respectively.'\n\nCase 1:\n'Find the LEAST NUMBER which when divided by 2, 3 and 5 leaves the remainder 1 in each case.'\n\nLCM(2,3,5)=30 so when 31 is divided by these numbers, it will leave a remainder of 1 in each case.\n\nCase 2:\n'Find the LEAST NUMBER which when divided by 2, 3 and 5 leaves the remainders 1, 2 and 4 respectively.'\n\nNote here that there is a common remainder: -1.\nWhy? When we say a number divided by 2 leaves a remainder of 1 we can also say it leaves a remainder of -1.\nWhen we say a number divided by 3 leaves a remainder of 2, we can also say it leaves a remainder of -1.\nSimilarly, when we say a number divided by 5 leaves a remainder of 4, we can also say it leaves a remainder of -1.\n\nMind you, here (x−a)=(y−b)=(z−c)=K -> (2−1)=(3−2)=(5−4)=1\n\nSo, just like in the case above, we find the LCM and ADD the common remainder (-1)\nLCM(2,3,5)=30 + (-1) since -1 is the common remainder, so: LCM - K.\n\n(iv) The greatest number which divides two numbers x and y, leaving the same remainder in each case is\nx-y\n\nWhy? Let's take two random numbers A = 45 and B = 59\n\nDifference between A and B = 14.\n1) If you check, 45 or 59 when divided by 14 leave the same remainder 3 in each case\n2) We get this result because say any number D that divides A to give a remainder 'r' will exhibit the same property after a gap of D\n3) That means if 45 divided by 14, the remainder is 3, then all numbers after a subsequent gap of 14 from 45 like 59, 73, 87, … will also leave the same remainder\n\n(v) The greatest number which divides three numbers x, y and z, leaving the same remainder in each case is\nHCF(x-y, y-z, z-x)\n\n(vi) The greatest number which divides two numbers x and y, leaving remainders a and b, is\nHCF(x-a, y-b)\n\nHCF of fractions\n= (HCF of Numerators)/(LCM of Denominators)\n\nLCM of fractions\n= (LCM of Numberators)/(HCF of Denominators)",
