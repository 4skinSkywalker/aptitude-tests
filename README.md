## Why is important to cultivate your mathematical reasoning?

As a human you have a brain, and that brain sets you apart from the rest of animals in the animal kingdom.
In our society mathematical reasoning is a precious skill to have, it is what sets apart mediocre thinkers from more insightful ones.

## What is Aptitude Test?

Aptitude Test is a web app, a battery of problems that will grow and sharpen your mathematical abilities.
You may feel you are weak and it's not for you, but trust me: it's hard at first because you don't know the mathematical language, but overtime you'll start to understand it and pick its properties and methods.

This web app is specifically thought and developed with math noobies in mind, there are glossaries with formulas on the top of each section and for each exercise there's usually a detailed explanation on how to solve it.
