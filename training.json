The goal is to bring the gold coin to the top by repeatedly moving the topmost coin to another position in the stack. Alice starts and the players take turns. A turn consists of moving the coin on the top to a position i below the top coin (0 ≤ i ≤ 20). We will call this an i-move (thus a 0-move implies doing nothing). The proviso is that an i-move cannot be repeated; for example once a player makes a 2-move, on subsequent turns neither player can make a 2-move. If the gold coin happens to be on top when it's a player's turn then the player wins the game. Initially, the gold coin is the third coin from the top. Then\n(A) In order to win, Alice's first move should be a 0-move.\n(B) In order to win, Alice's first move should be a 1-move.\n(C) Alice has no winning strategy.\n(D) In order to win, Alice's first move can be a 0-move or a 1-move",
